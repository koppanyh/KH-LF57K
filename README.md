# KH-LF57K
Code and design files for a custom Z80 computer with Forth operating system.

The KH-LF75K computer is a Z80 based single-board computer that was designed, built, and programmed by Koppany Horvath as a project for the University of La Verne's 2nd Mini Makers fair.

This is a collection of the software files for the operating system itself as well as any firmware for the Arduino microcontrollers used. Schematics and documentation of the hardware will also be stored here.

All of this content here is free to use for whatever you want. It is under the MIT License but I also require that you mention my name or GitHub account if you use any of my resources for anything.

Read the "Users Manual.pdf" file for more information on the computer.
